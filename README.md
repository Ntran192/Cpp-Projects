# C++ Projects and Learning
## About Me
I’m a Computer Science graduate with a minor in Cybersecurity, and I’ve always aspired to become a Software Developer or Engineer. Recently, I’ve found myself drawn to the field of cybersecurity, sparked by a newfound interest in the growing need for security in today’s tech-driven world. To support this career shift, I earned the CompTIA Security+ certification and have been diving deeper into this exciting and ever-evolving space.

During my studies, I primarily focused on programming in C++, with some experience in Java and Python as well. However, after graduating, I noticed my programming skills—particularly in C++—had started to slip. Realizing how much time and effort I’ve invested in honing these skills during college, I decided it was time to revisit and rebuild my foundation in C++.

## Why This Repository?
I created this repository to document my journey of relearning C++ and regaining confidence in my programming abilities. It’s a way for me to:

- Reconnect with my “home language” and strengthen my coding skills.
- Track my progress and growth as I practice and work on new challenges.
- Share my journey as a way to hold myself accountable and inspire others in similar situations.
